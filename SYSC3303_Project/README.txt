NOTE:  for this iteration we were unable to develop a clean way to turn of the server and client.  In eclipse, they can be shut down by pressing the red square above the consol window.  You can toggle through different consol windows by pressing the button above the consol with a picture of a monitor on it.  And pressing the "X" button above the consol windo will close a consol window if it is no longer running.
